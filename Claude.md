# Itqan Studio Website

## Brand Identity
- **Company**: Itqan Studio FZ LLC
- **Meaning**: "Itqan" = Excellence in Arabic
- **Tagline**: "Your brand has potential. We give it direction."
- **Tone**: Professional, confident, premium — not corporate or stiff

## Brand Colors
- Primary Dark: #2f1c2c (dark purple backgrounds)
- Primary Accent: #cca4c2 (light pink) — use on DARK backgrounds only
- Accent on Light: #6d4a66 (deeper mauve) — use on LIGHT/CREAM backgrounds only
- Secondary Accent: #d1c2a5 (beige)
- Cream/Warm White: #fffbf5 (card backgrounds)
- Text Primary: #1a1a1a
- Text Secondary: #666666
- Text on Dark: #fffbf5

### Dual Accent Color System
**CRITICAL:** #cca4c2 doesn't read well on light/cream backgrounds. Always apply:
- `text-brand-accent` (#cca4c2) — when element sits on `brand-dark` or any dark section (hero, benefits, CTA banner, dark headers, case study hero)
- `text-brand-accent-on-light` (#6d4a66) — when element sits on `brand-cream`, white, or light-tinted sections (bg-brand-accent/[0.18], bg-brand-cream)

This applies to: Playfair Display italic lines, section label icons, accent-colored UI elements.

## Typography
- **Headings (Primary)**: Manrope Bold — Bold, clean
- **Headings (Editorial/Accent)**: Playfair Display Italic — Used for
  taglines, pull quotes, highlighted phrases (e.g., the mauve-colored
  italic text like "Clarity, Precision & Results")
- **Body**: Manrope — Regular weight, 16px base
- **UI/Navigation**: Manrope — Medium weight

## Design Principles

Follow the design skills in /skills/taste-skill/SKILL.md and /skills/premium-skill/SKILL.md

- Dark sections alternate with light sections
- Cards have subtle rounded corners (8-12px)
- Generous whitespace — let the work breathe
- Purple/mauve gradient accents on dark sections
- Hover states on all interactive elements
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Animation Guidelines
- Page transitions: subtle fade-in
- Scroll animations: elements slide up with opacity
- Hover: scale(1.02) on cards, color transitions on buttons
- Keep animations under 400ms — elegant, not flashy
