/**
 * Self-hosted Umami analytics loader.
 *
 * WHY UMAMI RUNS WITHOUT A CONSENT GATE (and PostHog does not)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * PostHogProvider is deliberately blocked behind CookieBanner acceptance,
 * because PostHog sets cookies and localStorage identifiers and persists them
 * across sessions — that needs opt-in consent under GDPR/PECR.
 *
 * Umami is different by design: it sets NO cookies, writes NO localStorage, and
 * assigns no persistent cross-session identifier. Visitors are counted with a
 * salted hash that is rotated daily and never stored on the device. With no
 * data stored on or read from the visitor's terminal equipment, the PECR/
 * ePrivacy "cookie rule" (which is about storage/access, not about analytics
 * as an activity) does not apply, and there is nothing to consent to.
 *
 * The practical consequence is the entire reason for this file: analytics that
 * only load after an Accept click measure the subset of people who click
 * Accept. Cookieless analytics measure everyone. Those are very different
 * numbers, and only one of them is usable for deciding anything.
 *
 * Do Not Track is still honoured below — that is a courtesy, not a legal
 * requirement, and it is cheap.
 *
 * WHY A CLIENT FETCH INSTEAD OF A <script> IN THE LAYOUT
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * The pages are statically generated, so a script tag written at author time
 * would need a build-time env var and would be frozen into the deploy. This
 * fetches /api/analytics-config at request time instead. See that route for the
 * full reasoning. Unconfigured → `{}` → this component injects nothing.
